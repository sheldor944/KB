The 1944 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (Italian: V Giochi olimpici invernali) after the cancellation of 1940 Winter Olympics, were a planned international multi-sport event scheduled to have been held in February 1944 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The games were cancelled because of World War II alongside the 1944 Summer Olympics in London, Great Britain, and were the fourth games to be cancelled due to war.
The games eventually took place in St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1948. Cortina d'Ampezzo would later host the 1956 Winter Olympics, and will co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics with Milan.
