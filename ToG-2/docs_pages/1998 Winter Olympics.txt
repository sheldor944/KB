The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVIII Olympic Winter Games (Japanese: 第18回オリンピック冬季競技大会, Hepburn: Dai Jūhachi-kai Orinpikku Tōkikyōgi Taikai) and commonly known as Nagano 1998 (Japanese: 長野1998), were a winter multi-sport event held from 7 to 22 February 1998, mainly in Nagano, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, with some events taking place in the nearby mountain communities of Hakuba, Karuizawa, Nozawa Onsen, and Yamanouchi. The city of Nagano had previously been a candidate to host the 1940 Winter Olympics (which were later cancelled), as well as the 1972 Winter Olympics, but had been eliminated at the national level by Sapporo on both occasions.
The games hosted 2,176 athletes from 72 nations competing in 7 sports and 68 events.[1] The number of athletes and participating nations were a record at the time. The Games saw the introduction of women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding. National Hockey League players were allowed to participate in the men's ice hockey for the first time. Azerbaijan, Kenya, Macedonia, Uruguay, and Venezuela made their debut at the Winter Olympics.
The athlete who won the most medals at these games was the Russian cross-country skier Larisa Lazutina who won five medals, including three gold. The Norwegian cross-country skier Bjørn Dæhlie won four medals, including three gold, which took his total Olympic medal total to 12, including eight gold, which is a record for Winter Olympics. Czech men's ice hockey team won the gold medal. In Ski Jumping, Kazuyoshi Funaki won two gold medals and one silver for host Japan. The American Figure skater Tara Lipinski became the youngest champion in Olympic history at the age of 15 years and 255 days. Germany dominated the medal table with 29 medals, including 12 gold. Germany was followed by Norway and Russia, who won 25 and 18 medals respectively. Canada, which finished fourth in the medal table with 15 medals, including six gold, had its most successful Winter Olympics up until that point.
The host was selected on 15 June 1991, over Salt Lake City, Östersund, Jaca and Aosta. They were the third Olympic Games and second Winter Olympics to be held in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The hosting of the games improved transportation networks with the construction of the high-speed Shinkansen, the Nagano Shinkansen, now the Hokuriku Shinkansen, between Tokyo and Nagano Station, via Ōmiya and Takasaki. In addition, new highways were built, including the Nagano Expressway and the Jōshin-etsu Expressway and upgrades were made to existing roads.[2]


Host city selection[edit]
Main article: Bids for the 1998 Winter Olympics
In 1932, Japan won the rights to host the 1940 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. At that time, organizers of the Summer Olympics had priority in choosing the venue for the Winter Olympics the same year.[a 1] Several Japanese cities, including Nagano, prepared a bid. Sapporo was chosen; however, the games never took place because of World War II.[a 2] In 1961, Nagano declared its intention to host the 1968 Winter Olympics but lost to Sapporo, the winning Japanese bid, who lost to Grenoble, France, and Sapporo eventually won the right to host the 1972 Winter Olympics.[a 3]
Japanese private sector organizations, in 1983, began publicly discussing a possible bid.[a 4] Two years later, in 1985, the Nagano Prefectural Assembly, decided to begin the process to bid, for its third time, for a Winter Olympics.[a 5] The bid committee was established in July 1986, they submitted their bid to the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) in November of the same year. Other Japanese cities that were bidding were Asahikawa, Yamagata, and Morioka.[a 6] 1 June 1988, the JOC selected Nagano in the first round of national voting, receiving 34 of 45 votes.[a 7] In 1989, the bid committee was reorganized, with the Japanese Prime Minister as head of the committee. The number of committee members was 511.[a 8]
On 12 February 1990, the bid delegation presented its candidature at the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne before Juan Antonio Samaranch.[a 9] Other candidate cities for the 1998 Olympics were Aosta, Italy; Jaca, Spain; Östersund, Sweden; Salt Lake City, United States, and Sochi, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Russia).[a 10] The host city selection was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 15 June 1991, at the 97th IOC session.[a 11] After the first round of voting, Nagano led, with Aosta and Salt Lake City tied for last. Aosta was eliminated in a run-off against Salt Lake City. After the second round of voting, Nagano led with Salt Lake City in second, and Jaca was eliminated. Following round 3, Nagano continued to lead, with Salt Lake City in second, and Östersund was eliminated. Finally, Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes in the fifth round of voting, becoming the third Japanese city to host the games after Tokyo in 1964 Summer Olympics and Sapporo in 1972.[a 12] Nagano, at 36°N, is the southernmost city in the Northern hemisphere to host the Winter Olympics (1960 Winter Olympics host Squaw Valley, California is 39°N).[a 13] In June 1995, Salt Lake was chosen as the host of the following 2002 Winter Olympics.
Following a 2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal that occurred in the summer of 2000, Atlanta, host of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Nagano, and Sydney, host of the 2000 Summer Olympics, were suspected of similar improprieties in bidding practices. Although nothing illegal was ever done, gifts to IOC members were considered morally dubious.[3] The Nagano Olympic bid committee spent approximately $14 million to entertain the 62 International Olympic Committee members and many of their companions. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano, after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public, destroyed the financial records, according to bid member Junichi Yamaguchi.[4][5]

Organization[edit]
Furuhashi Hironoshin, past president of the JOC
Five months after the city was selected, the Nagano Olympic Organizing Committee (NAOC) was created. Eishiro Saito, Chairman of Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) was selected as president of the committee. There were four Vice Presidents: Goro Yoshimura, the Governor of Nagano Prefecture; Hironoshin Furuhashi, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee; Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the president of the Ski Association of Japan; and Tasuku Tsukada, the Mayor of Nagano City.[a 14] In addition, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Tadashi Tsuda, served as director-general.[a 15] Tsuda was replaced by Makoto Kobayashi in 1993.[a 16]
The organizing committee recognized three goals for the games, which they referred to as "Games from the Heart": promote youth participation, coexistence with nature, create a festival with peace and friendship at its centre.[a 17] To realize the first goal, a camp bringing together 217 young people from 51 countries was created, along with the program of "One school, one country" in Nagano Prefecture.[a 18] This program organized cultural exchanges with other countries. In addition, more than 100,000 tickets were reserved for children.[a 19] For the second point, the organizers attempted to minimize the impact on their nature and the local ecosystem.[a 20] Regarding the third point, an international truce organized by the United Nations in 1997 was adopted during the games.[a 21]

The Nagano Olympics Games are a link to the 21st century, inspiring our search for wisdom for the new ear, respect for the beauty and bounty of nature, furtherance of peace and goodwill. Friends worldwide are welcome to share, in the spirit of competition and fair play, the joys and glory of the XVIII Olympic Winter Games.[a 22]
In June 1998, four months after the Games, the NAOC presented a donation of US$1 million to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. This value come of the revenue of tickets sales and another actions from the committee.[a 23] In October of the same year, NAOC also donated the 3-D high vision theater and some structures that were used in Nagano Olympic Villages to the Olympic Museum.[a 24]
In February 1999, one year after the Games, the IOC awarded the Nagano the Olympic Cup, and presented the city a replica of the sculpture of stylized athletes raising the Olympic Flag by the Swiss artist Nag Arnoldi.[b 1]

Economic aspects[edit]
M-Wave
The costs of construction and of the land of the Olympic venues totaled ¥106.6 billion,[a 25] approximately 914 million US dollars. Of this, the Japanese national government spent ¥51.1 billion, the Nagano prefectural government spent ¥29.6 billion, and the cities and towns of Nagano, ¥23.4 billion; Hakuba, ¥1 billion; and Nozawa Onsen, ¥1.1 billion; shared the remaining ¥25.5 billion.[a 26] The most expensive venue was impressive M-Wave, the indoor rink which hosted the long-track speed skating events. It cost near ¥34.8 billion.[a 27] The two ice hockey venues, Big Hat and Aqua Wing Arena cost ¥19.1 and ¥9.1 billion respectively.[a 28] The White Ring (arena), which hosted figure skating and short-track speed skating cost ¥14.2 billion, the Spiral, which hosted bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton, cost ¥10.1 billion.[a 29] Another ¥8.6 billion was spent on the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium, ¥7 billion for Snow Harp – the cross-country skiing venue, and ¥3 billion for the biathlon venue at Nozawa Onsen Snow Resort.[a 30]
The organizing committee financed all costs, totaling ¥113.9 billion.[a 31] It spent ¥99.4 billion for operational expenses, ¥21.6 billion for public relations, ¥20.7 billion for installations, ¥18.4 billion for telecommunications, ¥15.9 billion for running the competitions, and ¥14.4 billion for administration.[a 32] Television rights were worth ¥35.4 billion, and marketing earned ¥31.3 billion.[a 33] Ticket sales were worth ¥10.5 billion.[a 34] The total cost of the Nagano Games is estimated to have been US$15.25 billion (in 2015), of which the largest factor in the cost of the games was the extension of the shinkansen to Nagano. This compares, for example, with US$2.5 billion for the 2002 Winter Olympics, US$4.35 billion for the 2006 Winter Olympics, US$7.56 billion for the 2010 Winter Olympics, and US$51 billion for the 2014 Winter Olympics[7]

Transportation[edit]

Nagano is situated at the Japanese Alps area and receives large snowfalls every year. These combined to make transportation an important challenge for the organizing committee. In addition, the Olympic Village was a distance of 7 kilometers from the center of the city, and sporting events were spread over five surrounding cities. The complicating matters were that many of the venues had one single road in-out, which limited possibilities and led to traffic jams.[a 35]
To improve access to Nagano, the government decided to link the prefecture with the high-speed shinkansen train network. Called Nagano Shinkansen (now the Hokuriku Shinkansen), it was inaugurated five months before the start of the Games. This reduced by half the travel time between Tokyo and Nagano, to 79 minutes for 221 kilometers.[a 36] The length of the track between Takasaki Station and Nagano Station is 125.7 km, which includes 63.4 km of tunnels. The high speed train network carried 655,000 passengers during the Games.[b 2]
Two highways, the Nagano Expressway and the Jōshin-etsu Expressway, were also built in the Nagano region.[b 3] In May 1993, the 75.8-kilometer section of the Nagano Expressway was completed, and in October 1997, the 111.4 kilometer section of the Jōshin-etsu Expressway was completed.[b 4] In addition, another 114.9 kilometers of roads within Nagano Prefecture were improved.[2]
Transportation systems for the Games ran for 33 days, from the opening of the Athletes Village until 3 days after the Paralympics closing ceremony, when the Village was  decommissioned from its functions. Approximately 64% of the athletes arrived between 1 and 6 February, and 74% left Nagano between 22 and 25 February.[a 37] Logistical operations were directed from the operational centre situated at the Organizing Committee headquarters. Two regional logistical minor hubs were created in Hakuba and Yamanouchi, as well as a traffic center for buses and cars in Karuizawa.[a 38] Originally it was expected that both athletes and media delegations would arrive entirely via Narita International Airport, which did not happen given the high demand for plane tickets. So some delegations had to arrive via Kansai International Airport and Chubu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya[a 39] The members of the IOC and the delegations who arrived in Narita traveled to Nagano via Shinkansen.[a 40]
To improve transportation for spectators, the number and hours of local trains were extended.[a 41] During the heaviest traffic days, more cars and buses were put in service and up to 68 parking areas, for 8,000 vehicles were at available for various Olympic delegations, and another 17 parking areas for 23,000 cars for spectators. Approximately 1,200 vehicles had navigation systems which transmitted their locations in a GPS system.[a 42]
As one of the principal aims of the Games was to respect nature, many vehicles were considered ecological or semi-ecological. In addition, there were more than 100 electric vehicles, hybrid mini-buses and other environmentally-friendly vehicles.[a 43]

Marketing[edit]

The emblem of the 1998 Winter Olympics consisted of a stylized snow flower with each petal representing an athlete participating in a winter sport. The figure could also represent a snowflake, or a mountain flower, which refers to the importance of the natural environment to the city of Nagano. Similarly, Tokyo used cherry blossoms in its logo for its candidature for the 2020 Summer Olympics.
Landor Associates conceived the official mascots that were used by the communication team for the Games. They consisted of four owlets, Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also called Snowlets. The names were chosen from more than 47,000 suggestions. Four represents the number of years between each Olympic Games, and also represent the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water.
The official poster for the Games was designed by the graphic designer Masuteru Aoba presented a thrush perched on ski poles with light in the background shining on snow-capped mountain peaks. Here, as with the emblem and the mascots, the importance of the natural environment in these Olympic Games and a desire to create harmony between athletes and the natural surroundings are shown. In addition to the official poster, a separate poster was created for the opening ceremony.[a 44] Marketing for the games cost the organizing committee 5.9 billion yen.[a 45]
These Olympic Games were sponsored by 11 worldwide partners, 8 gold partners, and 18 official supports and suppliers. Marketing revenues for sponsoring or for the rights to use the emblems and mascots of the Games totaled 31.3 billion yen.[a 46]

Mascots[edit]
Main article: Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki
Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also known as the Snowlets, are the 1998 Winter Olympic mascots and are four snowy owls. They represent respectively fire (Sukki), air (Nokki), earth (Lekki) and water (Tsukki) and together they represent the four major islands of Japan.

Sponsors of the 1998 Winter Olympics[edit]
The development of Rights Packages were based on International Olympic Committee policy of offering exclusive rights to a limited number of companies, with one company allowed to purchase the rights for any single product or service category, and these were based on previous Games, with adaptations for the local market.[a 47] Sponsors were permitted to use the emblem and mascots as long as consent was obtained from the International Olympic Committee, Japanese Olympic Committee, and the NAOC.[a 48] Hospitality packages for sponsors included priority for accommodations, tickets, and transportation services.[a 49] The Sponsor Hospitality Village, next to the Nagano Olympic Stadium, welcomed 32,000 guests.[a 50]
To promote awareness of the sponsors, advertising was done in various media from 1995, and on banners and buses immediately before the games.[a 51] Dick Pound noted, during the Games, the excellence of the marketing program, citing the "perfect example of how the private and public sectors can work together".[a 52]
The Games had 11 Worldwide Olympic Partners, eight Gold Sponsors and 18 Official Supporters and Suppliers.[a 53]

Ticket sales[edit]
From 7 February 1997, the organizing committee put up for sale 1,286,000 tickets for the various competitions and ceremonies. The number of tickets sold was 1,149,615, which represented 89.4% of available tickets. Including people connected to the Games, the total number of spectators was 1,275,529. This number was slightly higher than in 1994 as a result of the greater availability of tickets. This reflected the total capacity of the arenas used, which were mostly larger than those used four years earlier but slightly lower than the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Tickets sales were a success in the domestic market, as the Japanese people finished the process of purchase with a reservation list of 6 million. For the most popular events, a lottery system was used.[a 54] In total, ticket sales raised 10.5 billion yen for the organizing committee.[a 55]
The ice hockey matches represented 295,802 tickets sold, 26% of the total. Tickets sold for alpine skiing totaled 166,092; for ski jumping, 96,000, and speed skating, 93,000. For multiple sports, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing, all three skating disciplines, bobsleigh, and curling, as well as the ceremonies, all tickets were sold. By contrast, due the local demands and low interest only 56.6% of the 146,000 available tickets for cross-country skiing were sold.[a 56]

Cost and cost overrun[edit]
The Oxford Olympics Study established the outturn cost of the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics at US$2.2 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 56% in real terms.[8] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost and cost overrun for Nagano 1998 compares with costs of US$2.5 billion and a cost overrun of 13% for Vancouver 2010, and costs of US$51[9] billion and a cost overrun of 289% for Sochi 2014, the latter being the most costly Olympics to date. Average cost for Winter Games since 1960 is US$3.1 billion, average cost overrun is 142%.

Sport sites[edit]
During the 1998 Winter Olympics, a total of fourteen sports venues, all within Nagano Prefecture, were used. Construction of these venues lasted 7 years between 1990 and 1997, with construction and land costs totaling ¥106.6 billion.[a 57] The most expensive venue constructed for the games was the M-Wave who hosted the speed skating events.This venue is in a distance from 5 kilometers from Nagano Station. Between March 1996 and November 1997, these sites were tested with 16 different World Championship events, World Cups, and another international competitions to allow the organizers to prepare for the running of the Games.[a 58]
Five new venues were used, localized all inside city of Nagano urban area. The project to build the Olympic Stadium and the 4 indoor arenas was planned even before the plans for the Olympic bid. However, these plans were accelerated soon after the submission of the proposal to the Japanese Olympic Committee, as the city had no infrastructure available for any type of event available. The Nagano Olympic Stadium is the main sporting venue of the south of city, is on nearby Shinonoi Station, and approximately 9 kilometers from Nagano Station. Outside from their structure, the stadium, who resembles a cherry blossom, one of main symbols of Japan.During the Games, the arena was exclusively used for the opening and closing ceremonies and, when added to the temporary infrastructure, its capacity reached 50.000.[b 5]

Media Village at Asahi, with the M-Wave in the background
To accommodate the athletes and officials during the Games, the main Olympic Village was constructed in Imai district, this complex approximately 7 kilometers south of Nagano Station. Along with the construction of the village, Imai Station was opened in 1997. The responsibility for the construction of these buildings lay with the Nagano City, as a future public and low coast residential housing and was loaned to the organizing committee during the Games.[b 19] The main Village occupies an area that is 19 hectares, composed of 23 buildings with a total of 1,032 apartments.[b 20] Temporary infrastrure were also available during the Games.

The Games[edit]
The Olympic torch relay[edit]
Main article: 1998 Winter Olympics torch relay
The Nagano Olympic torch, displayed at the Olympic Museum in Nagano
The Olympic torch was lit by sunlight during the ceremony held Temple of Hera at Olympia, Greece on 19 December 1997. Vassilis Dimitriadis, a Greek alpine skier started the Greek leg towards Athens where the handover ceremony was held at the Panathenaic Stadium.The flame burned from 27 to 30 December in the Ginza yard, and from 31 December to 4 January in the Yoyogi Park.On the morning on that day the flame was split into three and taken by plane to three destinations: the Kantō route, starting from Hokkaido; the Pacific Ocean route, starting from Kagoshima; and the Sea of Japan route starting in Okinawa.On 23 January evening, the three flames arrived on Nagano Prefecture after 120 stops. Finally, these three routes were unified in the city of Nagano in on the night of 6 February. The following day, after traveling through each district of the city, the relays simultaneously arrived at the central square where three former athletes passed the flames to three members of the organizing committee who lit a celebration cauldron gathering the flame into one. After that, the unified flame was used to light another torch held by Juan Antonio Samaranch. In the early hours of the 7 February morning, the final leg started and the flame travelled another 10 kilometers to the Olympic Stadium and the figure skater Midori Ito lit the cauldron at Nagano Olympic Stadium during the opening ceremonies.
The Olympic Flame Relay in Japan was sponsored by Coca-Cola, lasted 33 days and travelled 1,162 kilometers. A group of 5.5 million people took part in relay activities. Over the distance of the relay, the flame was always followed by a group of six people: the torchbearer who carried the flame, some who accompanied the carrier, and four people in supporting roles, for a total of 6,901 people. In addition, each leg was followed by two groups of 11 vehicles and more than 20 people.
The torch was shaped like a traditional Japanese taimatsu torch. It was made of aluminum, was 55 centimeters long, and weighed 1.3 kilograms when it was assembled. The exterior of the torch was coloured silver, to represent winter. Runners wore blue and white uniforms mixing blue as the main colour of the look of the games and the white as snow. The runners' uniforms included logos for the Nagano Olympics and the Olympic Games, a logo of the relay, and of Coca-Cola.

Opening ceremony[edit]
Main article: 1998 Winter Olympics opening ceremony
The opening ceremony took place at the Nagano Olympic Stadium, Nagano, Japan, on the late morning of 7 February 1998.[11] Japanese figure skater, Midori Ito, the first female skater to land seven triple jumps in a free skating competition and also the first Asian world champion in 1989, and the silver medalist at the 1992 Winter Olympics, lit the cauldron during the ceremony.
Seiji Ozawa, a Japanese conductor, directed an orchestra from five continents (Beijing, Berlin, Cape Town, New York City, and Sydney - and the crowd in the Nagano Olympic Stadium),[12] to perform the fourth movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (Ode to Joy).[13][14] This was the first time a simultaneous international audio-visual performance had been achieved and was also the last time that the Olympics Opening ceremonies were held on a morning timeslot in the host city.[13][14][15]
In all, 2,302 athletes from 72 National Olympic Committees participated in the Games,[16] including 814 female athletes and 1488 male athletes. Both the number of participating delegations and the number of athletes participating in the competition were, at the time, the most ever hosted at the Winter Olympics.

Medal ceremonies[edit]
The version used at the time of the Olympic Charter, approved on September 5, 1997.
The Olympic Charter in force at that time determined that  (skating, ice hockey, and curling) were had to be at the event venues immediately after the finalsThe version used at the time of the Olympic Charter, approved on September 5, 1997. Determined that only award ceremonies for indoor events and those scheduled for the last day of competitions could be held immediately after the end of the respective events, while those relating to outdoor events would be held in two parts, the first carried out with the delivery of bouquets or gifts and the second on the same night with the delivery of medals in a public square.In Nagano, this plaza was localizated at the Nagano City Central Square, approximately midway between the city's main train stations:Nagano Station and Zenkō-ji Temple.[b 25][b 26] For the medal ceremonies, a total 167,200 tickets were sold. National and international artists presented every evening at the place before the medal presentations.[b 27]

The silver, gold and bronze medals of Nagano 1998
The gold, silver, and bronze medals each measured 80 mm in diameter and 9.7 mm in thickness.[b 28] The gold medals weighed 256 g, the silver 250 g, and the bronze 230 g.[b 29] The medals were made using a traditional Japanese lacquerware technique known as 漆器 (shikki), in which a brass core is imprinted with the design by layering gold powder onto the wet lacquer using a method called maki-e.[b 30] On the front of the medals are borders of olive leaves, and in the center, a maki-e morning sun rises over a cloisonné emblem of the Nagano Olympics.[b 31] On the reverse side, the snowflower emblem of the Games sits above a maki-e image of the mountains surrounding Nagano glowing in the morning sunrise.[b 32] The initial lacquering was handcrafted by artisans from the town Kiso, Nagano, and the metals components were added at the Mint Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Finance.[b 33]
In addition to the medals awarded to the athletes in each event, more than 19,000 commemorative medals were given to all athletes, officials, International Olympic Committee members, media personnel, volunteers and others. These medals, made by the Mint Bureau in cooperation with NAOC, were made from an alloy of 90% copper and 10% zinc.[b 34] As the Olympic Charter also determines, diplomas, written in Japanese, French, and English, were given to the top eight finishers in each event, and every participant also received a commemorative diploma.[b 35]

Closing ceremony[edit]
Main article: 1998 Winter Olympics closing ceremony
The closing ceremonies, like those of the opening, took place in the Nagano Olympic Stadium, with 50,000 tickets sold.Akihito, the Emperor of Japan at the time, and his wife Empress Michiko were also present. After the athletes entered, hundreds of drums were beat and a traditional hose and lion dance was presented. During the Antwerp Ceremony, Tasuku Tsukada, then mayor of Nagano presented the Olympic Flag to Deedee Corradini, then mayor of Salt Lake City, the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics.After the handover of the flag, the then IOC president  Juan Antonio Samaranch declared the games closed. This was followed by a performance from the Japanese singer Anri when the Olympic Cauldron was extinguished. The ceremony ended with the words "Sayonara, Arigato" ("Goodbye, Thank you"), a major fireworks performance accompanied by a party with the song: "Ile Aiye" performed by Japanese pop group Agharta.[17]

Main article: Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics
The ice hockey matches took place at two purpose-built arenas in Nagano City, Big Hat and Aqua Wing Arena. The ice hockey events were significant for two reasons: the first Olympic ice hockey tournament for women and the participation of players from the NHL, which scheduled its first ever mid-season break. The Czech Republic defeated Russia in the gold medal game for the men's title, and the United States defeated Canada in the gold medal game for the women's title.
The men's competition began on 7 February with eight teams playing in two groups of four, Group A and B, with each team playing three games. The winners of these two groups, Kazakhstan and Belarus, advanced to join Groups C and D, composed of the six highest ranked men's national ice hockey teams in the world. Russia, Czech Republic, and Finland were joined by Kazakhstan in Group C; Canada, Sweden, and the United States were joined by Belarus in Group D. On 22 February, with 10,010 spectators in attendance at Big Hat, the Czech Republic defeated Russia in the gold medal game, 1–0, with the lone goal of the match scored with 12 minutes remaining. Finland defeated Canada for the bronze medal by a score of 3–2.
The first women's ice hockey world championship, a biennial tournament, took place in 1990. Discussions to include women's ice hockey at the 1998 games began in 1992, and it was decided to include them in the program in 1993. The tournament included six teams playing in a one-group round-robin tournament. The top two team advanced to the gold medal game, and the teams ranked third and fourth played in the bronze medal match. The favorites were the Canadians, who had won the three previous world championships, with the Americans finishing second each time. In the round-robin tournament, the Americans finished first, with the Canadians second. In the last round-robin game, the United States handily defeated Canada, 7–4, with the two teams scoring nine goals in the third period. In the gold medal match, with 8,626 fans in attendance at Big Hat, the U.S. again defeated Canada, 3–1. Team Finland defeated Team China 4–1 for the bronze medal.

Main article: Luge at the 1998 Winter Olympics
Georg Hackl, seen here during competition at Oberhof, Germany in 2005, won gold in the men's singles luge competition.
The luge competitions took place in Iizuna, Nagano, at the Spiral (Nagano Bobsleigh-Luge Park), the first purpose-built permanent bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Asia. In all, 24 nations took part in the luge events, with four countries, India, South Korea, New Zealand, and Venezuela making their Olympic debut in luge events. There were three events, men's single, women's single, and doubles. Germany won all three gold medals, one silver, and one bronze. The United States won one silver and one bronze. Italy and Austria rounded out the medal table.
The first event with 24 lugers was the men's singles. Each athlete completed four runs over two days, 8 and 9 February. The German athlete, Georg Hackl, who had won gold at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1994 Winter Olympics, had entered the competition winless in the 1997–1998 season. Hackl raced in a newly designed luge and aerodynamic shoes. Several team protested but these protests were rejected. Hackl dominated all four races, and finished with a time of 3:18.436, half a second ahead of the Italian Armin Zöggeler. Zöggeler finished .154 seconds ahead of Jens Müller of Germany, who had won gold at the 1988 Winter Olympics when he competed for East Germany.

Main article: Ski jumping at the 1998 Winter Olympics
The ski jumping competitions took place at the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium in Hakuba village, 50 kilometers west of Nagano City. In all, 68 athletes from 19 countries participated. For the first time, the top 30 jumpers qualified for the second round. Host Japan won the most medals, including two gold in the large hill and large hill team. Finland, Germany, and Austria rounded out the medal table. Kazuyoshi Funaki from Yoichi, Hokkaido in Japan won two gold and one silver for the host country.
The normal hill jumps took place on 11 February in front of 45,000 spectators. The Japanese, who had dominated the 1997–98 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup season, were the favorites. With a jump of 91.5 meters, Masahiko Harada led after the first round ahead of the Finnish jumper, Jani Soininen
Kazuyoshi Funaki, who was fourth after the first round, took the lead with a jump of 90.5 meters in the second round.

Soininen won gold with 234.5 points, Funaki was second with 233.5, and the Austrian Andreas Widhölzl finished third with 232.5 points.
On 15 February, the large hill jump competition took place. 60,000 spectators gathered at Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium. Normal hill bronze medalist Widhölzl led after the first round, ahead of the Japanese jumper Takanobu Okabe, Jani Soininen et Funaki. In the second round, Funaki jumped 132.5 m, and, for the first time at the Olympics, received perfect points for his style. He jumped into first place and won the gold medal with 272.3 points overall. It was the first Japanese gold medal in ski jumping since the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Harada jumped next. Unfortunately, the measurement system was installed between 95 and 135 meters and his jump was beyond that. He was measured manually to be 136 meters. He also had good points but only managed to win the bronze medal with 258.3. meters. Soininen won the silver with a combined score of 260.8 points.

The last jumper was Funaki who jumped 125 meters, and the Japanese team became Olympic champions with 933.0 points.

Snowboarding[edit]
Main article: Snowboarding at the 1998 Winter Olympics
Ross Rebagliati (pictured in 2007) won the first-ever gold medal in men's giant slalom, before being disqualified, and then having his medal reinstated.
Nicola Thost (pictured in 2015) won the gold medal in women's halfpipe.
In the decade leading up the games, snowboarding had become popular in both North America and Europe, as well as Japan, and as a result, in August 1994, the NAOC received a request from the IOC president Samaranch to consider including snowboarding at the 1998 Winter Olympics.[a 60] To reduce costs, NAOC asked the host community to cover a portion of the costs – the town Yamanouchi agreed – and FIS was expected to support financially as well.[a 61] In November 1995, the NAOC executive board agreed to add snowboarding, and this was approved by the IOC at their December meeting the following month in Karuizawa.[a 62] This was the first Winter Olympics with snowboarding events. The events took place at Mount Yakebitai and Kanbayashi Snowboard Park in Yamanouchi, Nagano, 30 kilometers northeast of Nagano City, from 8 to 12 February. In all, 125 athletes from 22 countries participated in the men's and women's halfpipe and giant slalom. Athletes from Germany won two medals, including one gold. Athletes from Switzerland, France, and Canada also won gold medals.
In the men's giant slalom, the Canadian Jasey-Jay Anderson won the first race with a half-second lead ahead of Rebagliati. During the second race, the event was temporary delayed because of snow and fog. Ross Rebagliati finished with a combined time of 2:03.96, 0.02 seconds ahead of the Italian Thomas Prugger, and another 0.10 seconds ahead of the Swiss Ueli Kestenholz. Controversy occurred when three days after the men's giant slalom, the International Olympic Committee determined that gold medalist Rebagliati from Canada, was disqualified after testing positive for marijuana.[b 36] It was the first time in Olympic history that an athlete was disqualified for marijuana. The Canadian Olympic Committee lodged a protest and the case quickly went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport where it was ruled that because marijuana was not classified as a "banned" substance, the medal should be returned to the Canadian athlete. In the halfpipe, the gold medal went to the Swiss Gian Simmen, who had the highest score, 85.2, despite a heavy rain. The Norwegian Daniel Franck won the silver with a score of 82.4, and the American Ross Powers won the bronze with a score of 82.1.
The women's giant slalom was delayed one day because of a snowstorm. The big favorite, the Frenchwoman Karine Ruby won the first race with almost two seconds ahead of her compatriot Isabelle Blanc. Ruby won the second race, with Blanc missing the last gate and falling. Ruby's combined time was 2:17.34. The German Heidi Renoth won the silver with a time of 2:19.17, and the Austrian Brigitte Köck won the bronze with a time of 2:19.42. In the halfpipe, the Norwegian Stine Brun Kjeldaas won the qualification round. However, in the finals, the German Nicola Thost, a former gymnast, finished second in both legs, scored 74.6 points, which was enough for the gold medal. Stine Brun Kjeldaas finished fourth in the first leg and first in second, winning the silver with 74.2 points. The American Shannon Dunn-Downing won the first leg, but finished seventh in the second leg, leaving her with the bronze with a score of 72.8.

Media[edit]
Wakasato Civic Cultural Center in June 2006
The former IBC was converted into a departament store
The Nagano Olympics were covered by more than 10,000 members of the media, including 8,329 accredited journalists, of which 2,586 were from newspaper media and 5,743 television and radio journalists. The Organizing Committee established a Main Press Center (MPC), over two buildings, and 17 annexes throughout the different sites. The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was a temporary one-storey facility constructed on the grounds of a former textile mill in the immediate vicinity of the MPC and Big Hat.[a 63] A wide range of general services, such as a restaurants, cafeterias, banks, post offices and a medical clinics were available at the IBC.[a 64] The IBC was later converted into a departament store, K's Town Wakasato Store.
The MBC, which is today the Wakasato Civic Cultural Center,[20] was built beside Big Hat, the main ice hockey venue. The MBC had a surface area of 42,728 m2, with one principal room for 600 journalists of 1430m2 and another of 5100m2 that was rented by various press agencies.[a 65] The largest press offices at the Games were Kyodo News, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, and Deutsche Presse-Agentur.[a 66] The MBC also included a press conference room for 600 people.[a 67]
The host broadcaster for the Games, the Olympic Radio and Televisions Organization (ORTO'98) was established as a separate organization within NAOC, the organizing committee.[a 68] ORTO'98 was joint-venture created between NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), and NAOC.[a 69] A total of 1647 staff worked 386 cameras at the various venues and events,[a 70] with coverage increasing by 55% over the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.[a 71] The Games were broadcast in 160 countries, 40 more than in Lillehammer,[a 72] and it was estimated that 10.7 billion viewers watched the Games over the 16-day period.[a 73] Some events were filmed and broadcast in analog high-definition television, with NHK broadcasting over 270 hours of coverage in Japan.[21]
Broadcasting rights totaled USD$513 million, which was a record for the Winter Olympics, and all contracts with 16 broadcasting rights' holders were record sums.[a 74] This money was split 60–40 between NAOC and the International Olympic Committee.[a 75] The American broadcasting network, CBS, paid 375 million US dollars, to air the Games in the United States. The 1998 Winter Olympics are the most recent Olympic Games to not air on NBC in the United States, as the current contract with NBC started in 1999.
