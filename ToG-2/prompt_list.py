(The Great Wall of China, located in, China)
References:
The Great Wall of China, although a massive structure, is not visible to the naked eye from space
The myth that the Great Wall of China is visible from space was debunked
Answer: {{Yes}}, the first sentences explicitly states that the Great Wall is not visible from space with the naked eye. Additionally, the the second sentence confirms that this is a myth and was debunked. The knowledge triplets provide conflicting information, but the references clearly refute the claim. Therefore the answer is {{REFUTES}}

# Example 2:
Claim: "Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry."

References:
Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
Knowledge Triplets:
(Nobel Prize in Chemistry, won by, Marie Curie)
References:
Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.
Answer: {{No}}, the claim that "Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry" is not provided by the given references. The Wikipedia page states that Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics, not Chemistry. The Nobel Prize site mentions Marie Curie as a recipient of the Chemistry prize. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the claim. Thus The answer is {{NOT ENOUGH INFO}}.

# Example 3:
Claim: "CRISPR technology can be used to edit genes in human embryos."
Knowledge Triplets:

References:
CRISPR-Cas9 has been successfully used to edit genes in human embryos, raising both hopes for curing genetic diseases and ethical concerns.
Recent experiments have demonstrated the potential of CRISPR to edit genes in human embryos, though the technology is still in its experimental stages and surrounded by ethical debates.
Answer: {{Yes}}, the references explicitly states that CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to edit genes in human embryos, mentioning both the scientific success and the ethical implications. The references also confirms this by discussing recent experiments that have demonstrated the potential of CRISPR for gene editing in human embryos, although it notes that the technology is still experimental. The knowledge triplets align with the claim, and the references provide robust evidence to support it. There the answer is {{SUPPORTS}}

topic_prune_demos = '''
Given a question and a group of related topic entities derived from the Wikipedia knowledge graph, the task is to select which of these entities are suitable as starting points for reasoning on the wiki knowledge graph to find information and clues that are useful for answering the question. 
Note that your output should be strictly Json formatted: {id: entity}. 
Here are examples showing how to analyse and output a Json formatted answer:

Example 1:
question: What major city is the Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School located by?
topic entities: {
    "Q111": "Faith Lutheran Middle School",
    "Q39722": "Faith Lutheran High School"
}
Analysis: 
All entities are directly related to the core of the question—finding the possibale information about Faith Lutheran and its location.
Output: 
{"Q111": "Faith Lutheran Middle School"，"Q39722": "Faith Lutheran High School"}

Example 2:
question: How many Turkish verbs ending with “uş” with their lemma.
topic entities: {
    "Q24905": "verb"
}
Analysis: 
Q24905 "verb" focuses on verbs, which are action words in a language. The task involves not just identifying verbs but specifically Turkish verbs that end with the suffix "uş,". Therefore, the entity "verb" is too broad and does not point to a specific Turkish verbs. Thus there is no suitable topic entity as a starting point for reasoning. 
Output: 
{}

Example 3:
question: On which island is the Indonesian capital located?
topic entities: {
    "Q252": "Indonesia",
    "Q23442": "island"
}
Analysis: 
Q252 "Indonesia" represents the country of Indonesia. Considering the question is about the capital of Indonesia and which island it is located on, the entity "Indonesia" is directly related to the core of the question—finding the capital of Indonesia and then identifying the island it is situated on. Therefore, this entity is highly suitable as a starting point for reasoning. 
Q23442 "island" represents the concept of an island. While the question does indeed relate to an island, the concept of "island" itself is too broad and does not point to a specific geographical location or country. From the perspective of reasoning on a knowledge graph, trying to find the capital of a specific country based solely on the concept of an island is less relevant and efficient compared to starting from that country. 
Hence, Q252 "Indonesia" is the more suitable topic entity as a starting point for reasoning on the knowledge graph. It directly connects to the key information of the question and can effectively guide the search for entities related to the answer within the knowledge graph.
Output: 
{"Q252": "Indonesia"}
